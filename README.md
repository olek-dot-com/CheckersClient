# CheckersClient
"Object-oriented programming languages" project.
In this project I used SFML and ASIO library (https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9 - Link to the channel I learnt about ASIO library). After running a client, the terminal and the board are displayed. Terminal prints some useful information about what happened in the game. The bord is a board :)
